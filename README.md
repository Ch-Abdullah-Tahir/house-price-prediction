# House Price Prediction using Linear Regression 🏠

## Project Overview
This project predicts house prices using **Linear Regression**.  
The aim is to understand how different housing features affect prices through a simple and interpretable machine learning model.

## Dataset
- Housing dataset with features such as location, number of rooms, size, and price
- Data cleaned and prepared before modeling

## Tools & Libraries
- Python  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Matplotlib  
- **Seaborn**  
- Scikit-learn  

## Approach
1. Load and explore the dataset  
2. Visualize data using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
3. Clean and preprocess the data  
4. Select relevant features  
5. Train a **Linear Regression** model  
6. Evaluate model performance  

## Model Used
- **Linear Regression**

## Evaluation Metrics
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)  
- Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)  
- R² Score  

## Results
The Linear Regression model captured useful relationships between features and house prices and produced reasonable predictions.

## How to Run
1. Clone or download the repository  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook  
3. Run all cells in sequence  

## Future Improvements
- Better feature selection  
- Handling outliers  
- Trying advanced regression techniques
